# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**

This project is an admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions in a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. The dashboard allows administrators to:
- View and manage users
- Create, edit, and delete roles
- Assign permissions to roles and users
- Manage user status (active/inactive)

The dashboard is built using **React.js** and styled with **Bootstrap** to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

---

## **Features**

- **User Management**:
  - View, add, edit, and delete users.
  - Assign roles to users.
  - Toggle user status (active/inactive).
  
- **Role Management**:
  - Create, edit, and delete roles.
  - Assign permissions to roles (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).
  
- **Permissions Handling**:
  - View and manage permissions for different roles.
  - Dynamic permission grid to assign or modify permissions.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The UI adapts to different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, using the **Bootstrap grid system**.

- **Context-Based State Management**:
  - The app uses **React Context** to manage users, roles, and permissions across the app.

├── App.js                         # Main App component with routing and context
└── index.js                       # Entry point of the application
```

## **How the Application Works**

### **1. User Management**
- Users can be **viewed**, **added**, **edited**, and **deleted** from the user table.
- Users can be assigned roles, and their status can be toggled between **active** and **inactive**.

### **2. Role Management**
- Roles can be **created**, **edited**, and **deleted**.
- Each role can have specific **permissions** assigned (e.g., **Read**, **Write**, **Delete**).
- You can assign multiple roles to a user and manage their access levels via these roles.

### **3. Permissions Management**
- Permissions are displayed in a **dynamic grid** format, where you can assign **Read**, **Write**, or **Delete** permissions to each role.
- Permissions are managed for each role, and these roles are then assigned to users.

### **4. React Context for State Management**
- **UserContext**, **RoleContext**, and **PermissionContext** are used to manage and share state across the application.
- This ensures that the data remains consistent and accessible across different components.

### **5. Routing and Navigation**
- The app uses **React Router** for navigation, with three main pages:
  - `/users`: Displays the user management interface.
  - `/roles`: Displays the role management interface.
  - `/permissions`: Displays the permission grid.

### **6. Responsive UI**
- The layout uses **Bootstrap** to ensure the app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- On mobile devices, the sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu, and the layout adjusts for smaller screens.

## **Future Improvements**

If this project were to be further developed, some features that could be added include:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Add login functionality to ensure only authorized users can access the dashboard.
- **Backend Integration:** Implement a real API to manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically.
- **Real-Time Data Sync:** Allow the app to update data in real-time via WebSockets or polling from a backend.
- **Bulk Actions:** Enable bulk user actions, such as assigning roles or deleting users.
- **Detailed User Logs:** Track changes made to users, roles, and permissions for auditing purposes.
